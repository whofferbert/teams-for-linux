# Known issues

## Oauth services

Some services requires the app to open the windows in electron. An example is github that requires authentication using oauth.

We are defaulting in opening the links in a external browser, but links can be open ina electron windows by using the 'Crl+Click' combination.

## No history

Switching the userAgent with the persistence turn on sometimes have the side effect of "loosing" the channels history. Removing the data under the appropriate config directory should fix the issue.

### Config folder locations:

* Vanilla install: `rm -rf ~/.config/teams-for-linux`
* snap: `rm -rf ~/snap/teams-for-linux/current/.config/teams-for-linux/`
* --user installed flatpak: `rm -rf ~/.var/app/com.github.IsmaelMartinez.teams_for_linux/config/teams-for-linux`
* from source: `rm -rf ~/.config/Electron/`

## Spellchecker not working

Details are in issue [#28](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/teams-for-linux/issues/28)

In short, node_spellchecker only ships with en_US dictionary.

As a work around, you can enable the use of local dictionaries by installing hunspell and your locale dictionary as indicates in this link [https://github.com/atom/spell-check#debian-ubuntu-and-mint](https://github.com/atom/spell-check#debian-ubuntu-and-mint)

Also check [#154](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/teams-for-linux/issues/154) in case you have an issue with the detection of the locale.

## No desktop notifications

Some notifications daemons in linux don't support the implementation that Microsoft implemented in the browser.

This project includes a desktop notification hack that can be enable by running the application with `teams-for-linux --enableDesktopNotificationsHack`.

## Use camera using the Snap build

Snap uses confinement to provide more security, this restric the access to hardware or data on your device to prevent security issues.

The camera is a restricted device on Snap, so you need to allow the access to the camera on Teams For Linux to be able to do videocalls, to do that you can use the Software Store in your Operating System after the installation of the snap, look for a similar option in your Software Store app:

![Enable camera in Software Store](static/snap-store-permissons.png)

You can also use this command to create an interface to the camera:

```bash
sudo snap connect teams-for-linux:camera core:camera
```

## Blank page

Some users have reported a blank page on login (with the title `Microsoft Teams - initializing`).

The following workarounds tend to solve the issue:

+ Right click on the Microsoft Teams icon tray and click on Refresh. (Ctrl+R)

If the above doesn't work:

+ Close the application and delete the application cache folder
  + `.config/teams-for-linux/Partitions/teams-4-linux/Application Cache`
  + or for Snap installation, `snap/teams-for-linux/current/.config/teams-for-linux/Partitions/teams-4-linux/Application Cache`.

Refer to [#171](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/teams-for-linux/issues/171) for more info

If when you reload or close the application you get the blank page again, please repeat the second workaround.
